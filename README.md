**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**

The client for this software design document was a game developer named The Gaming Room. Their request was to develop a web-based, multiplatform game that is based on one of their current Android games, Draw It or Lose It. They also required that this game support multiple teams and players. 

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**

The research I did for this documentation was particularly well done, despite my lack of prior knowledge on various specifics related to web-based platforms or game development. I also feel my recommendations were clear and concise based on what I found in my research. The UML model and description contained in this documentation are also a strong part of this document thanks to the understanding they provide into the potential application's interworkings. 

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**

Laying out a rough idea of what was needed prior to developing the code was extremely helpful as it gave me a starting point, general direction, and architecture to follow. The requirements being listed clearly in the document gave me a spot to refer back to when necessary. The UML model, which laid out the general structure and architecture of the code, was another extremely useful aid. If I ever got stuck on what to write next, referring back to the UML model usually resolved it. 

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

The evaluation section of the document would be the section I would revise. I did a lot of research for every part of this design document, but I feel that I researched in the wrong direction for this section in particular. The reason I feel that way is because I took a very general approach to how I researched each platform. If I were to improve this section, I would look into web-based game development specifically when evaluating the different platforms a web-based game can be built for. 

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

I interpreted the user's needs and implemented them into my software design by adding the ability to have multiple teams, each with multiple players, thus allowing users to play with friends. Another way this was done was to implement a working role-based system that utilizes the REST API. Doing this can enable better security for future user data. Finally, the use of the REST API provides a path for the final application to become multiplatform, allowing users with different systems to have access to the game. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing an application because their user experience is a huge factor in whether they will continue to use your software. Not properly addressing a user's needs also allows competing applications that do take user needs into consideration to enter the market and take users away. 

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**

Utilizing the software design document as an outline was the approach I took when developing the code for this project. By using the documentation as a guideline, I was able to stay on track and code everything that was required within the scope of the project. This is only the third or fourth time that I have worked with a document such as this, so a future strategy would be to utilize one. This will be especially important as I will most likely encounter many similar documents in my professional life. If I needed to design a similar software application and needed outside input, I would most likely resort to online forums and see what others have done for similar applications. A fresh perspective can usually push through a roadblock in development pretty effectively.
